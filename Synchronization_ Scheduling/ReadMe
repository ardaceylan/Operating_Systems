In this project  a program that will simulate multiprocessor scheduling is implemented. The program will simulate two approaches for multiprocessor scheduling: single-queue approach, and multi-queue approach. In single-queue approach,program have a single common ready queue (runqueue) that is used by all processors. In multi-queue approach, each processor has its own ready queue. The program  simulates the following scheduling algorithms: FCFS (first-come first-served), SJF (shortest job first - nonpreemptive), and RR(Q) (round robin with time quantum Q). The program is called as mps. It will take the following arguments (options).
mps [-n N] [-a SAP QS] [-s ALG Q] [-i INFILE] [-m OUTMODE] [-o OUTFILE] [-r T T1 T2 L L1 L2 PC]
